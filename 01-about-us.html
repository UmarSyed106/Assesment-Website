    A few words from McNeil
    </h1>

<p>
    Hello traveler. I love the Fiordlands. I traveled to the fiordlands for over 30 years. I practically grew up here. 
    I grew to feel a sense of connection towards the Fiordlands, almost like my secondary home. 
    I want everyone to feel the same connection I feel towards the landscape. That is my ultimate goal and why Destination Fiordland exists.
